# GiphyAPI
This applicaton allows users to search for Gif images. Gif is the acronym for graphic interchange format. They consist of
a file format that incorporates both static and animated images. They are seen on the web and even in your iMessages.
My application has default buttons with some of my favorite artists. Once you click on the buttons 10 gifs appear 
that repersent each artist. You have the capability of searching for other gifs that are not displayed on my application.
Once you click on search your new submission populates with the list of the other buttons on the page. Enjoy searching through as many gifs as you please!
